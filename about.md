Hello! I’m Hamid Wakili, a passionate and versatile full-stack software engineer with over a decade of hands-on experience across backend, frontend, and mobile development. I’ve had the privilege of working on a diverse range of innovative projects, from building a digital picture book library with video chat for children to developing a highly scalable business card platform. My journey as a software engineer has not only sharpened my technical skills but also nurtured my love for problem-solving, teamwork, and delivering solutions that make a real difference.
