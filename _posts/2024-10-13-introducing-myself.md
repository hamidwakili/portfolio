Hello! I'm Hamid Wakili, a passionate and versatile full-stack software engineer with over a decade of hands-on experience across backend, frontend, and mobile development. I’ve had the privilege of working on a diverse range of innovative projects, from building a digital picture book library with video chat for children to developing a highly scalable business card platform. My journey as a software engineer has not only sharpened my technical skills but also nurtured my love for problem-solving, teamwork, and delivering solutions that make a real difference.

## My Journey

Over the course of my career, I’ve gained extensive experience working with various programming languages, frameworks, and tools. My work has involved translating design mockups into functional and responsive web applications, building mobile apps, designing and implementing complex backend systems, and managing database architectures. I’ve developed a solid foundation in **Agile methodologies** (Scrum, Kanban) and am well-versed in **DevOps practices**, ensuring smooth and efficient development cycles.

From early on, I’ve embraced a hands-on approach, working closely with cross-functional teams and clients to ensure that every project aligns with the user’s needs and business goals. My ability to adapt to new challenges and my enthusiasm for continuous learning have allowed me to grow both as an individual developer and a team player.

## Technical Expertise

- **Frontend Development:** I specialize in JavaScript, TypeScript, and React, focusing on creating intuitive and responsive user interfaces. Whether it's transforming Figma designs into sleek web apps or optimizing front-end performance, I ensure the user experience is always a priority.

- **Backend Development:** I have extensive experience with languages such as PHP, Scala, Java, Python, Ruby, and Go, allowing me to build secure, scalable, and high-performance backend systems. I also excel in API development and integrating backend services with various databases.

- **Mobile Development:** I’ve worked on multiple mobile platforms using **Flutter**, **React Native**, **Objective-C**, and **Swift**, crafting apps that run smoothly across Android and iOS devices.

- **DevOps & Tools:** With strong proficiency in **Kubernetes**, **Docker**, **Jira**, and **Confluence**, I ensure seamless deployment and maintenance of applications. I’m also comfortable with managing CI/CD pipelines, automating builds, and container orchestration for scalable solutions.

- **Database Management:** I’m proficient in managing **PostgreSQL**, **MySQL**, and **Cassandra** databases. Designing robust data models, optimizing queries, and ensuring data security and integrity are key aspects of my work in this area.

- **Quality Assurance:** Delivering high-quality software is one of my top priorities. I’m experienced in **unit testing**, **functional testing**, **end-to-end (E2E) testing**, and **code reviews**, ensuring that every feature works seamlessly before it reaches the end user.

## Highlighted Projects

Throughout my career, I’ve taken on key roles in projects that required a mix of creativity, technical expertise, and leadership. Some of the most rewarding projects I’ve worked on include:

- **Digital Picture Book Library with Video Chat:** I was responsible for developing the user interface for both web and mobile platforms and building the backend logic and database architecture. This project allowed me to create a platform that lets parents read books to their children remotely, combining the functionality of a video chat with an interactive picture book library.

- **Digital Business Card Platform:** I engineered and launched a digital business card platform that handles medium traffic and provides users with an easy way to manage and share their business details. This project required selecting the appropriate technology stack, organizing sprints, and ensuring a smooth and timely release cycle.

- **AI and Image Segmentation Projects:** I’ve also delved into AI, developing models like **YOLOv3** for real-time pedestrian and vehicle detection. Another exciting project involved building a fully convolutional neural network for image segmentation, pushing my skills into the realm of computer vision and AI.

## What Drives Me

What excites me most about being a software engineer is the opportunity to create solutions that have a real impact on people’s lives. I’m always eager to tackle new challenges, learn emerging technologies, and find better ways to solve problems. I approach every project with curiosity, dedication, and a focus on delivering exceptional results.

I also enjoy contributing to open-source communities, where I’ve made valuable contributions, such as creating a popular **Flutter** library and contributing to **FastAPI OAuth pipelines**. Sharing knowledge and learning from others keeps me motivated to grow both as a developer and as a part of the tech community.
